= Docker: Liquibase with Postgres support

image:https://travis-ci.org/aetheric/docker-liquibase-postgres.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.org/aetheric/docker-liquibase-postgres"]

A development environment for liquibase that projects can use as a base.

== Usage

Just get to running docker commands:
+
[source,shell]
----
docker run aetheric/liquibase:postgres \
	--volume .:/usr/work \
	--interactive \
	--tty \
	update
----

It's a good idea to put that last one in a script so commands can be run against the project a lot easier. Alternately, you can run it with the `--interactive` flag to just keep running commands.
